1. GRADLE_HOME setting problems
If installed by Homebrew, the installation locations is got by
brew info gradle

Update the GRADLE_HOME variable:
Append 'libexec' to the end of the installation location
export GRADLE_HOME=path
export PATH=$GRADLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
apply change by running source .bash_profile

2. JAVA_HOME setting problems
Check the location for all versions of java installed
/usr/libexec/java_home  -V

Other steps are the same as the GRADLE_HOME setting process
