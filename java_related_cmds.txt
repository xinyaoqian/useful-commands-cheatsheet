1. GRADLE_HOME setting problems
If installed by Homebrew, the installation locations is got by
brew info gradle

Update the GRADLE_HOME variable:
Append 'libexec' to the end of the installation location
export GRADLE_HOME=path
export PATH=$GRADLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
apply change by running source .bash_profile

2. JAVA_HOME setting problems
Check the location for all versions of java installed
/usr/libexec/java_home  -V

Other steps are the same as the GRADLE_HOME setting process

1. NullPointerException
NullPointerException is the exception that occurs when you declare a variable but did not create an object
Ex:
public void doSomething(SomeObject obj) {
   //do something to obj
}
If the obj passed in not initialized, and a method is intended to do something with the obj, then an exception will be thrown.
But, if the intention of the method is not solely to manipulate on the obj, then a null parameter may be acceptable. In this case, you would need to check for a null parameter and behave differently. Like:
public void doSomething(SomeObject obj) {
    if(obj != null) {
       //do something
    } else {
       //do something else
    }
}
